### First repo to clone after booting into a new machine.

* dotFiles: includes all my general config files and installs them as symlinks in the new system
* manjaro_packages: Install packages i generally use.(Tested on Manjaro KDE, can work on arch/arch based Distros using pacman, not sure about pamac[AUR])
* Random_Scripts: Well, the title does the job. :)
